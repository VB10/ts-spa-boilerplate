# [JS Boilerplate](https://github.com/larukedi/js-boilerplate)

JS Boilerplate is a front-end development setup for starting with a structured,
scaleable and adaptable basecode.

This project is the product of many years of iterative development and combined
community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development philosophy or
framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.
